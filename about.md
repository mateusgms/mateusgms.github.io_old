I'm a senior full-stack developer with over 7 years of experience building scalable web apps and robust APIs using Javascript, Typescript, React, Node.js and other modern technologies.

I currently work at Kintsu, where I develop a health tech platform using Typescript, Express, Vue.js and AWS services. Previously at Accenture, I worked on white-label financial apps built with Java, Angular and a microservices architecture.

Throughout my career, I have delivered meaningful results including developing a massively scalable cloud platform that now serves millions of users globally. I have a proven track record of solving complex technical problems and building robust back-end and front-end solutions. 

I continuously seek to improve my technical and leadership skills. I'm a creative problem-solver, working well in teams or independently. My goals are to expand my skills as a software engineer and take on technical leadership positions.
